Massive Coupon - An Open Source Crowd Buying engine

Here it is boys and girls ... a decent starting point for your own Groupon clone. I wrote this over 2 weekends and spent some coin designing it - and now I'm giving it all away for FREE!

Why am I doing this?  Why not?  I decided not to launch due to increasing competition - so my loss is your gain!  I hope to see some cool development and branches come out of this thing.   The open-source community has hooked me up big time over the years - Linux, Apache, Python, Django and on and on....  so I'm hoping this will help someone out.

Features:

- Nice Design (all html / css / graphics included!)
- Basic Groupon functionality (deal timeouts, tipping point, checkout, paypal express integration)


The engine is written in Python + Django .. any decent Django coder should be able to get it up and running.  I didn't have too much time to clean it up .. so it's 'as is'.

Good luck and happy group buying!
